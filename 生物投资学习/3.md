in this video we'll introduce the 
 concept of valuation in biotech we'll 
 discuss why evaluation matters and then 
 give a brief overview of different 
 valuation techniques so this will set 
 the stage for subsequent videos where 
 we'll talk about more more specifics 
 around dcf and comp space evaluation 
 techniques so in previous videos we 
 talked about value which is uh the value 
 of a company is the present value of the 
 cash it generates in the future and 
 valuation is just a way of estimating 
 what the present value of those future 
 cash flows are right because these 
 happen in the future you can't know what 
 they are you can only do your best to 
 estimate them and that's what evaluation 
 is in large part about 
 so we're going to start off with an 
 example here of a hypothetical company 
 aptly named hypothetical therapeutics 
 and this is going to help illustrate 
 why valuation matters and how you can 
 use it in biotech to make better 
 investments so this is a hypothetical 
 oncology company their lead asset is in 
 a phase 2 study 
 their market cap is 100 million 
 70 million in cash no debt 
 and they recently traded down 80 percent 
 from a prior market cap of 500 million 
 because a competitor targeting the same 
 pathway as hypothetical therapeutics had 
 an unacceptable safety signal in their 
 phase two the drug seemed to be 
 effective in uh reducing tumor volume 
 but there were unacceptable side effects 
 so competitors stock traded down and 
 because hypothetical therapeutics 
 targets the same pathway their stock 
 traded down as well 
 so this is something that you'll see 
 fairly uh fairly often in biotech 
 so in previous videos we talked about 
 how a stock might move due to the 
 company releasing clinical data but a 
 lot of times if there's clinical data 
 that comes out for another drug that's 
 in a similar class or targets the same 
 target or has a similar mechanism of 
 action you will often see read through 
 from one company's data to another's uh 
 data in in stock price as well because 
 they have similar similar products from 
 a scientific or clinical perspective so 
 we'll quickly walk through 
 this super high level um you know 
 hypothetical mechanism of action here so 
 we can better understand how um 
 [Music] 
 how scientific insight 
 why scientific insight matters and how 
 you can use valuation to support your 
 your scientific insight in your decision 
 making around investing so this 
 competitor drug inhibits the target 
 and then that leads to tumor shrinkage 
 which is good but there are also safety 
 issues which are not so good 
 however you happen to do research in 
 your phd study 
 research of this pathway and you happen 
 to know a little bit more than the 
 market does about how 
 this particular protein functions 
 and specifically you know that there are 
 two main downstream proteins that 
 mediate the effects of this this target 
 protein so there's downstream protein 
 one 
 uh that is increased by this protein and 
 then higher levels of this protein lead 
 to tumor growth and then we have 
 downstream protein two which is involved 
 in healthy function and levels of this 
 protein are also increased by um 
 by the target protein 
 so the competitor drug inhibits the 
 target here 
 which reduces downstream levels of both 
 of these proteins in this case of 
 downstream protein 1 reducing levels is 
 good because that shrinks tumor 
 but in the case of downstream protein 2 
 is not good to reduce the levels of this 
 protein because it's either for healthy 
 function so it causes safety issues 
 so if you pause here and think about 
 this from sort of a drug design 
 perspective 
 you might think that well why don't you 
 just target downstream protein one that 
 way you would get the positive effects 
 of tumor shrinkage and you wouldn't mess 
 with this pathway that's important for 
 for normal healthy function and that's 
 in fact what hypothetical therapeutics 
 is doing so they've designed an 
 inhibitor uh specifically downstream 
 protein one that leads to tumor 
 shrinkage and it doesn't mess with the 
 healthy function um that density protein 
 2 is involved in 
 okay so with that in a very high level 
 fact pattern in mind 
 um in the the valuation information and 
 information on the trading history of 
 the company do you invest so just to 
 recap 
 this company hypothetical therapeutics 
 traded down 80 
 because the competitor study failed the 
 competitive study failed because despite 
 their drug being effective at shrinking 
 the tumor it had unacceptable side 
 effects 
 you have done a lot of research in the 
 in the space studying the pathway that 
 both of these companies target 
 and you have a really strong conviction 
 that the mechanism of action of 
 hypothetical therapeutics product will 
 avoid the safety issues that 
 the competitors saw so do you invest 
 so it's not a trick question here um but 
 we'll just kind of go through a 
 simple quantitative 
 example of how you can think about uh 
 this investment decision a little bit 
 more quantitative matter 
 so the current market up is 100 million 
 dollars and we're assuming this is a 
 single asset company and this phase 2 
 study is sort of the biggest driver of 
 the company's valuation 
 so essentially you can decompose the 
 market cap into 
 the probability of success of the study 
 times the market cap if the study 
 succeeds 
 plus one minus the probability of 
 success of the study times the markup of 
 the study fails 
 and here we assume that 500 million is 
 the markup of the study succeeds because 
 that's where the stock was trading prior 
 to the competitor's negative data 
 readout in reality the stock would 
 probably trade higher than 500 million 
 uh if if the study was successful just 
 because that 500 million dollar 
 evaluation probably baked in some 
 probability of failure for the phase two 
 study and once the face study to study 
 is actually successful 
 then that probability of failure will no 
 longer exist um so the valuation will be 
 higher 
 we've used 50 million here as the markup 
 of the study fails they have like 70 
 million in cash um so we just assume 
 that they traded a slight discount to 
 cash if this study fails and it's their 
 their only asset so we can quickly solve 
 for probability of success 
 and it's like 11 in this example but 
 again because 
 the 500 million dollars you can almost 
 think of that as a floor for the 
 company's valuation if the phase 2 study 
 is positive 
 in reality the market's describing 
 probably a less than 10 percent 
 probability of success to this study 
 so if you think that the probability of 
 success is dramatically higher than 10 
 percent then this might be a good 
 investment 
 but what if you think the probability of 
 investment is like 
 15 or 20 
 can you invest around that or does it 
 need to be you know do you need to think 
 it's like a 50 or a higher probability 
 of success to invest so that's sort of 
 where evaluation comes in another way to 
 think about that is you know maybe you 
 invest if the market is 100 million but 
 what if the markup is 200 million 
 what if it's 500 million what if it's a 
 billion 
 as the market cap 
 at which you invest increases 
 the probability of success in the market 
 is pricing and also increases 
 so if you think the study is going to 
 succeed you don't really have as much of 
 a divergent view if the market also 
 thinks that the study is going to 
 succeed so 
 obviously if you think about it the 
 investing decision should become more 
 difficult 
 as the market cap if the company 
 gets higher 
 so one thing this evaluation can help 
 you do and this is how i like to think 
 about valuation especially from a 
 clinical or earlier stage 
 biotech perspective is evaluation helps 
 you understand the terms and the odds of 
 the bet that you're making 
 so when i say the terms of the bet 
 i mean which assumptions are you betting 
 on which assumptions is the market 
 betting on so in hypothetical 
 therapeutics example 
 the probability of success of that phase 
 two study is really the core 
 assumption that drives the stock price 
 in the near term 
 the stock might also move based on 
 information around um you know the 
 ultimate market size or some other 
 competitor drug that's earlier stage or 
 various other things like that but all 
 of those assumptions don't have as much 
 impact on the near-term valuation as 
 this probability of success for the 
 phase 2 study and when you do a 
 valuation analysis you will get a better 
 better insight into which assumptions 
 drive the stock in the near term and you 
 should supplement this by talking to 
 other investors and sort of getting a 
 sense for what consensus is but 
 valuation is a good way to ensure rigor 
 and discipline around that exercise so 
 addition to getting to you the terms of 
 the bet 
 evaluation can help you understand the 
 odds of the bet 
 how much you might make if you're right 
 and how much you might lose if you're 
 wrong so in our example of hypothetical 
 therapeutics at 100 million valuation 
 if um 
 the phase 2 study succeeds the stock's 
 going to go up at least 5x you think 
 and then if the study fails the stock 
 will go down probably at most 50 
 so your upside is much higher than your 
 downside in that case and that's an 
 important thing to take into account 
 when you're making an investment 
 decision right if the market cap is 500 
 million and you think that it's going to 
 trade up to 600 million if it's 
 successful but if the study fails you 
 think it's gonna trade back down to 50 
 million then your upside is much lower 
 and your downside is much higher 
 and the odds of that bet are not as 
 favorable to you if you're if you're an 
 investor if you're a buyer of that stock 
 however these the terms and the odds of 
 the bet are not the sole inputs into the 
 investment decision obviously 
 your risk tolerance target return and 
 conviction in your thesis will determine 
 what odds you accept 
 so if you 
 have a certain financial goal that 
 requires you to get at least a 10 return 
 on each investment you make then 
 obviously you're going to need that 
 level of return 
 for each investment in order for it to 
 make sense for you and your personal 
 goals likewise your conviction and your 
 thesis is very very important so in the 
 hypothetical therapeutics example if you 
 have a ton of conviction that 
 hypothetical therapeutics mechanisms of 
 action will avoid the safety effects the 
 competitors saw then you can invest at a 
 much higher valuation 
 so for sort of a way to put this in in 
 terms of the you know the formula we 
 laid out 
 if you have a high degree of confidence 
 that the probability of success at that 
 phase two study is like sixty percent 
 and the market's pricing at under ten 
 percent 
 then that's an investment that you 
 should make as long as you know your 
 target return is under under five x 
 however if you don't have a ton of 
 conviction in their thesis if you think 
 yeah this might actually work but you're 
 not totally sure then maybe you invested 
 100 million but maybe at 200 million 300 
 400 million 
 maybe that's a little bit too tight for 
 you maybe that doesn't provide you 
 enough margin of safety given your 
 conviction and maybe you don't invest at 
 that level and then obviously risk 
 tolerance is a huge factor as well the 
 higher your risk tolerance the more 
 investments are acceptable to you um 
 because you don't really care as much 
 about if you if you lose money 
 so another thing that i'll mention here 
 about evaluation is when you read about 
 evaluation or hear people talk about 
 valuation a lot of times you hear them 
 say 
 it helps you determine the intrinsic 
 value or the fair value of a company 
 and that's partially true but that can 
 be a little bit of a siren song when you 
 think talk about early stage biotech 
 valuation because 
 any evaluation technique you perform 
 even like the best most rigorous dcf for 
 an early stage or a clinical stage 
 biotech company 
 is going to be so uncertain there are so 
 many assumptions that go into that model 
 and each of those assumptions has a huge 
 impact on the overall stock price so if 
 you're a little bit wrong on a key 
 assumption your valuation is going to be 
 completely incorrect 
 so yes you can think about valuation uh 
 uh in a 
 from the perspective of an investor in 
 early stage buy tech companies you can 
 think about valuation as a way to sort 
 of get at the fair value of a product 
 but 
 with the huge caveat that you need to be 
 very very careful about how much 
 confidence you have in that valuation 
 these are imprecise and inaccurate 
 valuations 
 so just be very mindful of that this is 
 an art it's not a science 
 so how do you actually 
 implement that caution how do you 
 actually act on that advice of you know 
 be careful about um 
 relying too much on evaluation it is 
 quickly don't use evaluation analysis as 
 a big um 
 as a reason to invest 
 right just saying a company is 
 undervalued is not a reason to invest in 
 in biotech you need to start with a 
 differentiated view on the science or 
 the market opportunity or even something 
 like the management team 
 and then you do your evaluation analysis 
 to tell you 
 okay 
 this different view that i have on 
 something about the company does the 
 market care about that does that move 
 the stock price so that's the first 
 thing that's the terms of that we talked 
 about and secondly think about 
 if you're right about this divergent 
 view if you think something that the 
 market doesn't think and you're right 
 how much do you make if you're right and 
 then how much do you lose if you're 
 wrong so what are the odds of the bet 
 okay so when i talk about valuation and 
 biotech a lot of what i'm talking about 
 is really just understanding the terms 
 and the odds of the bet 
 you can get a rough sense of a company's 
 value as well but just be mindful it's a 
 very rough sense of the valuation now if 
 you are in a different field if you're 
 not an investor if you're like an 
 accountant for example 
 and you're doing evaluation for like 409 
 a purposes 
 then you're going to look at valuation 
 from a different perspective you don't 
 care about the odds in terms of the bet 
 you want to find a specific value that's 
 defensible that you can use for your 
 work likewise even if you're a financial 
 analyst 
 at a big pharma company and you're 
 working with a huge team of people to um 
 value a potential acquisition target for 
 example 
 then you're 
 the goal of your evaluation is different 
 the role of you 
 the role your role as an analyst doing 
 the valuation is different so you're 
 going to approach valuation from a 
 different way and use different 
 techniques so a lot of the stuff that i 
 talk about here in these videos is 
 specific to investing uh and specific to 
 investing in early stage biotech 
 and basically the what the most 
 important takeaway here is 
 the strength of your assumptions is much 
 more important than the robustness of 
 your evaluation models here which is why 
 it's so important to have scientists and 
 medical doctors in biotech investment 
 because 
 everything is really driven by this 
 differentiated view on the science the 
 clinical profile or the market 
 opportunity the valuation analysis is 
 supplementary not primary 
 all right so with that out of the way 
 this is a quick overview of common 
 valuation techniques so we'll go through 
 each of these in more detail in 
 subsequent videos but this is just an 
 overview of uh some common ways to value 
 companies in general and then the ones 
 in bold are commonly used in biotech so 
 there's two basic 
 buckets of valuation techniques that are 
 used 
 so one is 
 fundamental evaluation methodologies of 
 which discounted cash flow analysis is 
 very prominent and when i say 
 fundamental i mean you're trying to get 
 at uh the 
 future cash flows that a company will 
 generate and then determine the value of 
 the company that way 
 the second bucket are multiples based 
 valuation or comps so these are more 
 like market-based as opposed to 
 fundamental base valuation metrics and 
 when i say market base i mean you're 
 thinking about the value of a company 
 in terms of what others are willing to 
 pay for for that company you still think 
 about some of the fundamental drivers of 
 value um but but there's a much bigger 
 input the market valuation and the price 
 investors willing to pay is a much 
 bigger input 
 so i'll quickly walk through these here 
 and then we'll go on another slide to 
 touch them in more detail and then 
 subsequent videos we'll go through even 
 more 
 um but the dcf you're basically building 
 a model here to 
 project the cash flows 
 every year in the future up to a certain 
 time period and then discount those cash 
 flows back to a present value 
 so we'll talk more about what discount 
 rate and discounting means but 
 just for now just know that um it 
 represents what's called the time value 
 of money which means a dollar today is 
 worth more than a dollar tomorrow 
 um because you can invest that dollar 
 and you can generate a return 
 um if you invested today so that dollar 
 today invested at say a five percent 
 interest rate will be worth you know a 
 dollar and five cents in a year um so a 
 dollar today is worth more than a dollar 
 tomorrow and then the discount rate uh 
 is different depending on the company 
 but in general 
 you can think about it as the 
 opportunity cost of an investment so if 
 you have 100 to invest and you have six 
 things that you can invest in 
 um you have to think about not just the 
 return from an individual investment but 
 what return would you get if you 
 invested in something else right so if 
 your investment a gives you a 10 return 
 but you think investment b is going to 
 give you a 15 return 
 then you should probably invest in 
 investment b 
 but you would need to discount 
 investment b by 10 percent which is the 
 the discount rate um that you would use 
 because that's what you can get from 
 investing in other products so don't 
 worry about that if it doesn't make too 
 much sense now just for now know that 
 the dcf you project the cash flows that 
 a company will generate in future years 
 and then you just discount them back 
 because the money tomorrow is worth less 
 than money today 
 so the next bucket 
 our comps-based valuation techniques so 
 these comp space evaluation techniques 
 basically abstract a lot of the 
 assumptions away from a dcf so when you 
 build a dcf you have a lot of specific 
 assumptions that you're forecasting 
 around the number of patients who get a 
 drug what the price is going to be what 
 revenue is how revenue grows every year 
 a bunch of assumptions around the 
 different costs of the business there's 
 a lot of complexity that goes into 
 building a dcf comp space valuation you 
 abstract a lot of the assumptions away 
 you say we don't care about a lot of 
 these assumptions 
 in most cases you know we're gonna have 
 similar assumptions for like cogs for um 
 you know company a and company b 
 so we can abstract a lot of that away 
 and then just have a constant called the 
 multiple 
 that represents 
 all of these assumptions at a dcf and 
 then you use one specific financial 
 metric 
 as your your variable of interest so 
 basically 
 to do a comp space valuation you pick a 
 set of similar companies called comps so 
 for a phase two oncology company like 
 hypothetical therapeutics you'd probably 
 get a group of other you know oncology 
 small molecule therapeutics and 
 mid-stage clinical studies 
 and then for each comp you calculate the 
 relevant metric 
 so 
 earlier we have here different metrics 
 so all of these are ratios that you use 
 to calculate multiples for comps so 
 these are all different ways to abstract 
 away different 
 different assumptions around a company's 
 financial performance and sort of 
 normalize it with a certain financial 
 metrics so they're all of the format 
 the numerator 
 is some uh you know equity value or 
 enterprise value some way to measure the 
 value of a company and then the 
 denominator is a specific financial 
 metric usually related to 
 earnings or profit or to revenue so here 
 pe 
 you're looking at market cap or equity 
 value over net income which is a profit 
 metric 
 ev to ebitda is another common 
 ratio not as much use in early age 
 biotech but here you're looking at 
 enterprise value and you're dividing it 
 by ebitda which is another sort of 
 earnings metric you also look at 
 enterprise value divided by revenue 
 enterprise value divided by peak sales 
 which is basically revenue but 
 when you do a revenue multiple like this 
 you're either doing it on last year's 
 revenue or next year's revenue or 
 revenue in three years 
 um but in peak sales you don't care 
 about a specific year you just want to 
 get the year the level of peak sales and 
 then discount to m a value is a little 
 bit different we'll talk about that 
 later 
 but all of these comps are the format 
 the numerator is equity value enterprise 
 value and the denominator is a revenue 
 or a profit metric so then once you have 
 your comp set and you have your target 
 you know metric that you're looking to 
 calculate just do that simple math for 
 each company in the comp set 
 and then that will get you a value ratio 
 range from your target company 
 so if your comp set for example 
 um if you're looking at you know ev to 
 peak sales and 
 you have 10 companies you calculate even 
 peak sales for each of those companies 
 the average multiple is let's say 
 5x 
 then you might just multiply the peak 
 sales of your target company by five and 
 that will get you your enterprise value 
 sometimes you'll use the median value 
 sometimes you'll have a you know a wider 
 range of the values you use from the 
 comp set 
 um but that's the basic principle behind 
 it 
 so we'll talk about this in a different 
 video but just to sort of start you 
 thinking about the logic behind these 
 comp sets and how you could use them in 
 practice 
 so why might one company have a higher 
 revenue multiple than another similar 
 company so if they're both targeting the 
 same indication and it's a somewhat 
 similar mechanism of action maybe a 
 little bit different 
 maybe it's going after a different 
 target but the same patient population 
 why might one company have a higher 
 revenue multiple than another company 
 and another question to think about is 
 why would you use a revenue multiple in 
 early stage biotech as opposed to 
 a 
 an earnings multiple which is commonly 
 used for for other industries 
 additionally why would we use peak 
 revenue 
 as opposed to using next year's revenue 
 or last year's revenue or revenue in 
 three years so just things to think 
 about to understand sort of the logic 
 behind valuation we'll talk about those 
 more later 
 um and this is just a quick chart that 
 sort of lays out uh these different 
 evaluation techniques used for early 
 stage biotech 
 on a couple axes so this y-axis just the 
 time it takes to do the analysis so 
 discount m a um 
 is basically a valuation technique where 
 you say 
 for this particular type of company 
 it's often acquired by a larger pharma 
 company 
 at some point 
 so 
 to value that company you're sort of 
 arbitraging um 
 sort of like an m a sort of arbitrage 
 you think that a company might be 
 acquired um so you value it based on 
 some discount to the price at which an 
 acquirer might pay for it so you just 
 pick a group of companies that are 
 similar that have been acquired see the 
 valuation that they had and then you 
 just say maybe you know we think there's 
 a 25 chance that this company will be 
 acquired at a level um similar to what 
 the comps were required at and then you 
 do your evaluation that way very quick 
 and dirty other hand you have a dcf 
 where you have to literally forecast and 
 do research on dozens of assumptions 
 and then the actual calculation is a 
 little bit more complex as well so that 
 takes a lot more time and then a peak 
 sales multiple is somewhere in between 
 finding the peak sales of a bunch of 
 different companies is a little bit more 
 time intensive than finding the the m a 
 comps 
 but it's still a pretty straightforward 
 exercise to do this and then we talked a 
 little bit about market base versus 
 fundamental earlier 
 um 
 so the dcf is more fundamental it still 
 does take input from 
 from the market but you're really more 
 focused explicitly on understanding the 
 fundamental underlying assumptions that 
 drive the future cash for the business 
 whereas something like a discount to m a 
 you really just care about what others 
 are paying for these assets and you only 
 care about the fundamentals in as much 
 as they are incorporated in the 
 valuation that other companies pay or um 
 you know with respect to the specific 
 odds that you used to handicap the 
 likelihood a particular company will be 
 acquired 
 and then peak sales multiple is is 
 somewhere in between you are taking a 
 lot of input from the market 
 but then when you choose your multiple 
 you are thinking about specific 
 fundamental considerations of of a 
 company and as you do more dcfs and get 
 more familiar with what moose stock 
 prices and um which assumptions you use 
 and how companies stack up on financial 
 metrics 
 then you can start being more 
 comfortable using comps 
 um because at the end of the day again 
 comp just abstract away a lot of the 
 complexity of a dcf 
 and if you have a good sense for 
 what drives what moves the stock price 
 then you can be a little bit more 
 intuitive about using comps but for most 
 or pretty much all evaluations you're 
 going to use a variety of techniques to 
 to arrive at the valuation that you 
 ultimately uh use to inform your 
 investment decision 
 so that's it for this video next video 
 we'll talk about 
 discounted cash flow analysis 
 specifically uh there's a spreadsheet 
 that i've put together google should 
 have put together that walks through an 
 example dcf and tells you sort of what 
 each line item represents where you can 
 find the information to support each 
 assumption and that will be shared in 
 the next video as well so thanks for
